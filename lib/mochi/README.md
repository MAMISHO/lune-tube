## Mochi UI Library

Mochi is an modern touch-focused UI library for Enyo 2.

Note: Mochi is currently a work-in-progress library that is currently community 
managed.  Specifically, Mochi has not been tested or optimized on all platforms that
Enyo core supports, and many controls are still work in progress.

The full design specifications for the Mochi library can be found here:
https://github.com/enyojs/mochi/wiki/Mochi-Designs

Contributors to help complete the implementation against the envisoned design are 
welcome!  Please see the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
